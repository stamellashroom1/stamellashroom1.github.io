            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p>
                I am some guy who likes to have a play around with code and
                loves overcomplicating things. I go by stamellashroom1 on most platforms.
            </p>
            <h3>Coding Experience</h3>
            <p>
                I am an amateur coder, with a bit of a understanding in these languages:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a class="blue" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/stamellashroom1/">Scratch</a> (yes my main language is Scratch, you got a problem?)
                    <span class="blue" id="scratchInfo">*</span></li>
                    <p id="scratch">It says my profile is new, but that's because my main may or may not have my name in it</p>
                <li>JavaScript. I'm still learning this.</li>
                <li>I have a very basic understanding of Python.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                And of course, I know my way around HTML and CSS.
